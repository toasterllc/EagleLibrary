* Lead-free solder: SN100C

    - Product:
        - AIM SN100C (solder type: SN100C)
            Next time, try:
                SN100C-WS482-3%-020, since it contains water-soluble flux.

            Previously tried:
                SN100C with 'Glow Core' previously. It works well, but flux isn't water soluable

* Lead-free solder paste: SAC305
    - Rationale
        Ideally we'd get SN100C solder paste, but it doesn't seem to be common. SAC305 seems like the next best thing.
    
    - Product:
        Next time, try a water-washable solder paste:
            AMTECH LF-4300 solder paste

                Can we find this in a syringe?

* Flux: AMTECH 4300/LF-4300-TF Water Washable Lead-Free Tacky Solder Flux
    https://amtechdirect.com/shop/amtech-4300-lf-4300-tf-water-washable-lead-free-tacky-solder-flux-rel0-75g-jar/
    Datasheet: http://www.inventecusa.com/assets/4300-lf4300-tf.pdf
    
    - Rationale:
        - Tried it ourself -- way easier to clean! It easily washes away with water.
        - Doesn't corrode if it's not cleaned up (see datasheet)
        - Datasheet: "can be left on the board for many SMT assemblies"




* Flux: AMTECH VS-213-A-TF No-Clean Universal Halogen-Free Tacky Solder 
    https://amtechdirect.com/product/amtech-vs-213-a-tf-tacky-solder-flux/
    
    - Rationale:
        - Louis Rossmann recommends Amtech products
        - "Designed for LGA, BGA, and CSP components"
        - "Optimized for lead-free and standard alloy systems"
    
    - Review
        Works well, but doesn't clean easily. Next time try a water-washable flux (see above).
