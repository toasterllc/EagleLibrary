Board Finalization Checklist

    - Schematic: Verify that all parts have the correct footprint

    - Schematic: Renumber parts based on schematic so that part numbers are organized
        - Tools > Renumber parts...

    - Schematic: Export BOM and make sure all part numbers look good on Mouser

    - Layout:
        - ICE40: Verify that pins within PLL IO tiles are either unused pins, or output-only pins (ie, the pins are not used as inputs)
            - Only output pins are allowed on IO tiles which have an active PLL
            - For the ICE40HX4K-BG121, the PLL IO tiles are: B6, L5
            - If this rule isn't adhered too, it will make using the PLL on that respective IO tile impossible
            - If PLLs aren't used, then this rule can be ignored

        - ICE40: Verify that PIO pairs (2 pads that share the same PIO tile) use the same INPUT_CLK / OUTPUT_CLK / CLOCK_ENABLE.
            - Best way is to make a simple design that uses all the IOs as they will eventually be used (in/out/inout)
                - nextpnr will give an error if there's a conflict:
                    ERROR: Bel 'X33/Y4/io1' of type 'SB_IO' is not valid for cell 'IO_B' of type 'SB_IO'

    - Layout: Ensure isolation on top/bottom layers is >= 10 mil
        In the past we've had issues with solder bridging across a component's pad to the surrounding ground plane

    - Layout: Ensure all silkscreen labels are >= 20 mil (for readability)

    - Layout: Ensure silkscreen labels are unobscured

    - Layout: Add GND vias throughout board

    - Layout: Make sure there are no GNDX nets (which appear when copying vias)

    - Layout: Make all via diameters 'auto'

    - Layout: Make sure vias are tented

    - Layout: Make sure top/bottom cream layers look sane

    - Layout: Make sure pins of BGA chips don't have cream applied

    - Layout: Miter board corners

    - Layout: Ensure bottom-left corner of board is at origin (0,0)
        - This is needed for VisualPlace.exe to work properly.

    - Layout: Update RevX text on board

    - Export board:
        - Use OSHPark-Export-4Layer-MillingSlotPaths.cam script to export the design as a .zip of gerbers
            - We use this to export slots correctly, since Eagle doesn't support slots natively
            - See https://docs.oshpark.com/design-tools/eagle/cutouts-and-slots/

    - Order parts

    - Order boards

    - Order stencils
         - Use 3 mil thickness (4 mil seems to apply solder that's too thick)
