Board Finalization Checklist

- Schematic: Verify that all parts have the correct footprint
- Schematic: Renumber parts based on schematic so that part numbers are organized
- Schematic: Export BOM and make sure all part numbers look good on Mouser
- Layout: Ensure isolation on top/bottom layers is >= 10 mil
  In the past we've had issues with solder bridging across a component's pad to the surrounding ground plane
- Layout: Ensure all silkscreen labels are >= 20 mil (for readability)
- Layout: Ensure silkscreen labels are unobscured
- Layout: Add GND vias throughout board
- Layout: Make sure there are no GNDX nets (which appear when copying vias)
- Layout: Make sure vias are tented
- Layout: Make sure top/bottom cream layers look sane
- Layout: Make sure pins of BGA chips don't have cream applied
- Layout: Miter board corners
- Layout: Update RevX text on board
- Order parts
- Order boards
- Order stencils
  - Use 3 mil thickness (4 mil seems to apply solder that's too thick)
